# MusicGenreClassification

Project for machine learning course where the goal is to classify music into the right genre.

## TODO
- [x] Data exploration
  - [x] Read music file
  - [x] Vizualize waveform
  - [x] Extract time domain features
  - [x] Extract frequency domain features
- [x] Extract features from data and save them in dataframe
- [x] Vizualize with PCA or t-SNE
- [ ] Run traditional machine learning algorithms (k-NN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Logistical Regression)
  - [x] Preliminary run with default parameters
  - [ ] Evaluate features with relifF or similar 
  - [ ] Find the best parameters for each method
- [ ] Extract image features from data
- [ ] Run different CNNs on image data
- [ ] To be continued
